        <p class="lead" style="font-weight:500;">New Zealand has a fascinating history about our mix of Maori and
          European culture.

        <p class="history-text-title" style="font-weight: 700">Maori's story</p>
        <p class="history-text">Kupe was the first explorer to reach New
          Zealand, he used the stars and ocean currents
          as his navigation in the Pacific Ocean, it's said that Kupe made
          landfall at the Hokianga Harbour in the Northland, hundreds of years ago.

        <p class="history-text-title" style="font-weight: 700">Europeans story</p>
        <p class="history-text">A Dutch explorer Abel Tasman was on a quest to find a great southern continent it was
          believed to be rich in minerals, while searching for this continent.
          Tasman spotted a large "high-lying land." Tasman sailed up the country's west coast and sailed to the top of
          the South Island, this was Tasman's first contact with Maori.
          Two wakas' full with Maori People Spotted Tasman's boat. Tasman's men went on a small boat towards the land,
          Tasman's men got rammed by one of the wakas', four of Tasman's men were killed.
          Tasman didn't reach the land, and went on to some pacific islands then went back to Batavia (now Jakarta) in
          the Dutch East.
          Tasman found no treasures or valuable items his mission to New Zealand was considered unsuccessful.

        <h3 class="display-4 lead">Treaty of Waitangi
          <hr class="line-1">
        </h3>
        <p class="history-text-title" style="font-weight:700">What is the
          Treaty of Waitangi</p>
        <p class="history-text">The Treaty of Waitangi is an agreement made in
          1840 between representatives of the
          British
          Crown and more than 500 Maori chiefs. it's a document of central
          importance to the history and political
          constitution of the state of New Zealand.</p>

        <p class="history-text-title" style="font-weight: 700">Treaty first
          signed</p>
        <p class="history-text">The Treaty of Waitangi first signed on 6
          February 1840, most chiefs signed a
          Maori-language
          version of the treaty. The English and Maori-language versions held
          different meanings, Maori and Europeans
          therefore had different expectations of the treaty's terms. Ever
          since, resolution of these differences has
          presented New Zealand with challenges. It resulted in the
          declaration of British sovereignty over New Zealand
          by
          Lieutenant Governor William Hobson in May 1840. The British
          government finally decided to take action on New
          Zealand in 1839. It appointed a naval captain, William Hobson, as
          consul to an independent New Zealand, and as
          lieutenant governor to any parts o bmbljf the country that Māori
          would consent to becoming British. His
          instructions directed him to negotiate for the sovereignty of New
          Zealand, and to establish a British colony.
        </p>
        <p class="history-text-title" style="font-weight:700">Text of the treaty</p>
        <p class="history-text">The text of the Treaty includes a preamble and three articles. It is bilingual, with the
          Māori text translated from the English.
          Article one of the English text cedes "all rights and powers of sovereignty" to the Crown. Article two
          establishes the continued ownership of the Māori over their lands and establishes the exclusive right of
          pre-emption of the Crown.
          Article three gives Māori people full rights and protections as British subjects. However, the English text
          and the Māori text differ in meaning significantly,
          particularly in relation to the meaning of having and ceding sovereignty. These discrepancies led to
          disagreements
          in the decades following the signing, eventually culminating in the New Zealand Wars.
